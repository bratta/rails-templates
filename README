This repository contains some Rails 2.3 templates for generating applications.

The basic template sets up common plugins and gems, including stubbing out an eycap-based deploy.rb file. It also will optionally set up a home controller, and add your project to a git repository.

USING:

rails myapp -m http://github.com/bratta/rails-templates/raw/master/basic.rb

Or clone the repository and do:

rails myapp -m path/to/rails-templates/basic.rb

TODO: 
* Flesh this file out
* Configure the plugins included with the basic template
* Create templates for other broad use cases
